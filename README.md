## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### 1. 📥 Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MalikHashirShakeel/ClassConnect.git
cd ClassConnect
```

### 2. 🧪 Set Up Virtual Environment
Make sure Python is installed.

- **Windows**
```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

- **macOS/Linux**
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. 📦 Install Python Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. 📝 Set Up Environment Variables
1. Copy the example environment file:
```bash
cp .env.example .env   # Use `copy .env.example .env` on Windows
```
2. Fill in your own credentials for database, email, and superuser.

### 5. 🛠️ Apply Database Migrations
```bash
cd classroom_web_app
python manage.py migrate
```

### 6. 📐 Build Tailwind CSS
Tailwind requires a separate process to watch and compile CSS.

#### Open **Terminal 1**:
```bash
# Activate virtual environment
cd ClassConnect
venv\Scripts\activate   # or `source venv/bin/activate` on macOS/Linux
cd classroom_web_app
python manage.py tailwind start
```
This watches for Tailwind CSS changes and updates output in real time.

#### Open **Terminal 2**:
```bash
# Activate virtual environment again
cd ClassConnect
venv\Scripts\activate   # or `source venv/bin/activate`
cd classroom_web_app
python manage.py runserver
```

Now open your browser and go to:
[http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000)

## 🧠 Tips
- If Tailwind styles don’t apply, make sure `tailwind.config.js` and static setup is correct.
- Keep both terminals open for real-time Tailwind and Django updates.
- Use `.env.example` as a reference for required environment variables.
- Run `python manage.py createsuperuser` if you prefer manual admin setup.
